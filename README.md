# Reinforcement-Learning

This repository provides implementations for the algorithms presented in the [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2018jan1.pdf) and serve as a learning exercise.

The algorithms are written in Python 3 and use environments from [Open AI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/), together with some custom environments.

The repository is organized as follows:
* The library module contains all the environments and algorithms needed for experimentation
  - the environments module contains the testing environments
  - the td_learning module contains all the algorithms related to temporal difference learning
* The playgrounds module contains jupyter notebooks with experiments on each topic
