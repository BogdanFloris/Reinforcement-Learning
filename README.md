# Reinforcement-Learning

This repository provides implementations for the algorithms presented in the [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2018jan1.pdf) and serve as a learning exercise.

The algorithms are written in Python 3 and use environments from [Open AI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/), together with some custom environments.
